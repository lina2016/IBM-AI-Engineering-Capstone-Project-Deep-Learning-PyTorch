# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate:
## AI Capstone Project Deep Learning PyTorch
AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning is a final assignment for the online course on IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. 
Module 1: In this module, you will get introduced to the problem that we will try to solve throughout the course. You will also learn how to load the image dataset, manipulate images, and visualize them.
<!--Learning Objectives
 - Identify the problem and get acquainted with the data that will be used to build an image classifier.
 - Load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the image dataset.-->
Module 2:In this Module, you will mainly learn how to process image data and prepare it to build a classifier using pre-trained models. 
<!--Learning Objectives
 - Process data and prepare it to build a classifier using pre-trained models.-->
Module 3:In this Module, in the PyTorch part, you will learn how to build a linear classifier. 
<!--Learning Objectives
 - Build a linear image classifier in PyTorch.-->
Module 4:In this Module, in the PyTorch part, you will complete a peer review assessment where you will be asked to build an image classifier using the ResNet18 pre-trained model.
<!--Learning Objectives
 - Build an image classifier using the ResNet18 pretrained models using PyTorch.
 - Complete a peer review assignment-->
